As a Product Designer, you'll work alongside a UX Designer and a Product Manager, to turn user stories into lovely visual interfaces. Your main jam is interface design, but you love to make icons, branding concepts, and do some illustrations too.</p><p>Your <em>tool du jour</em> is Sketch, but maybe you're also playing with Figma, and you likely still lean on trusty ol' Illustrator for some vectors. You're used to sharing work in Invision, gathering feedback, and iterating over a design to really nail it. You have experience with design systems (or are curious about them), and you have a portfolio of work ready to share.</p><p><br></p><h6>About Input Logic</h6><p>We launch beautifully crafted apps and interfaces for brands and startups. As a small team, we hand-pick our clients and prefer to work with startups, or brands who think like startups (move fast and make things). We love coffee, board games, and spending time outside on our Vancouver Island playground.</p><p><br></p><h6>Additional</h6><p>Full time, on-site and/or remote, from our office in Nanaimo, BC.</p><p>To apply, <a href=\"mailto:hello@inputlogic.ca?subject=Product Designer\" target=\"_blank\">email us</a> a link to your portfolio and we will consider it lovingly.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"mailto:hello@inputlogic.ca?subject=Product Designer\" target=\"_blank\">Apply Now</a></p>",
